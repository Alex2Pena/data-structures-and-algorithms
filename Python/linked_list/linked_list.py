# Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
# Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).
# Structure and Testing
# Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

# Write tests to prove the following functionality:

# Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
# Can properly insert into the linked list
# The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
# Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
# Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
# Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
# Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
# Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

# Stretch Goal
# Create a new branch called doubly-linked-list, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a doubly linked list (completely separate from your singly linked list).
