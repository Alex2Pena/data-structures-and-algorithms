# Features
# Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
# Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
# Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
# Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
# Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
# "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
# Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
# Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).
# Structure and Testing
# Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

# Write tests to prove the following functionality:

# Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
# Can properly insert into the linked list
# The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
# Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
# Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
# Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
# Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
# Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

# Stretch Goal
# Create a new branch called doubly-linked-list, and, using the resources available to you online, implement a doubly linked list (completely separate from your singly linked list).
