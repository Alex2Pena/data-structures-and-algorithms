# Hashtables

In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key).

## Challenge

> Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

> add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

> get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

> contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

> hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
