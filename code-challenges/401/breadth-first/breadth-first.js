// Specifications
// Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
// Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md.
// Create a new branch in your repo called breadth-first.
// Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
// This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
// On your branch…
// C#: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
// JavaScript: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
// Python: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
// Java: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
// Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
// NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
// Feature Tasks
// Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.
// Example
