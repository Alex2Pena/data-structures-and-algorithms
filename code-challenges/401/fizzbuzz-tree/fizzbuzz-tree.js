// Code Challenge
// Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

// Specifications
// Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
// Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md.
// Create a new branch in your repo called fizzbuzz-tree.
// Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
// This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
// On your branch, create…
// C#: a new .NET Core console project named FizzBuzzTree. Within your Program.cs create a new static method outside of Main() following the naming conventions below. Call your newly created method in Main() once complete.
// JavaScript: a folder named fizzBuzzTree which contains a file called fizz-buzz-tree.js
// Python: a folder named fizz_buzz_tree which contains a file called fizz_buzz_tree.py
// Java: a file called FizzBuzzTree.java in your utilities package
// Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
// NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
// Feature Tasks
// Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
// Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
// If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
// If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
// If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
// If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
// Return the new tree.
